# Java Brainfuck

![image](https://i.imgur.com/tTip51r.png)

## what can it do

- Interpret brainfuck code
- Accept inputs
- Change cell size (8 bit to 32 bit)
- Have delay
- Breakpoints, but not really, its just a visual indication
- Enable or disable wrapping
- Enable or disable negative numbers

### This is not optimized

Will refactor later

### the sample code in the picture

The hello world brainfuck code is not mine, I found it in coldegolf lol, will add the link later
